# Mogra (મોગરા)

Mogra Gujarati + Latin | Google Web Fonts Development

With dense letterforms that borrow heavily from a broad-nibbed marker
Mogra Gujarati looks to emphasise that defining gujarati out-stroke with size,
weight, and flair. The implied bloating of the marker pen creates an interesting
roundness that contrasts against the relatively fixed angle the pen holds.
